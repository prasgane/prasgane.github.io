Hello! I am a research faculty at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at the University of Florida's Research Engineering Education Facility (UF REEF) in Shalimar Florida.

I work at the Autonomous Vehicles lab and function as a research engineer/ lab manager. My research interest are in estimation and control for autonomous agents in an indoor environment. 
I am also interested in Machine learning (both deep learning and bayesian inference) and agricultural robotics. 

I received my Master's from the University of Colorado at Boulder in Aerospace Engineering sciences. I worked at the [Bio-Inspired Perception and Robotics Laboratory](http://boulderbprl.com/) at CU under Prof. Sean Humbert.
