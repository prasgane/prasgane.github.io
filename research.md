My research interest are:
* Autonomy for robotics - estimation, controls, pathplanning 
* Percpetion for autonomy - machine vision, bayesian sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification in vision
* Developing robotic platforms for indoor enviroments using COTS components 
* Artificical intelligence for autonomous agents - multi-agent optimzation, deep learning

Research Projects:

* SLAM for Single and Multi-agents 
* Uncertainty quantification in Visual Odometry algorithms
* Semantic SLAM using planes
* REEF Estimator and Controls - An open-source velocity estimator and controller for research labs
* Mapping using magentic fields
