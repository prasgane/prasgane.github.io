I am a Research Faculty in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Florida and I currently help manage the Autonomous Vehicles Lab. I received my Master's in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder and my Bachelor's from Anna University, India. I have been in my current role since 2017.

My research is in the areas of guidance, navigation and control for multi-agent robotic systems. I am interested in developing tools for autnomy for robots and enjoy hardware implementation to validate theory.
